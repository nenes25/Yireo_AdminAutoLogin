# Yireo AdminAutoLogin

**Automatically login a specified user without any JavaScript trick or weird redirect, but simply by spoofing the login mechanism**

**Obviously, don't use in production.**

## Usage
Install this module with your jedi skills.

Next, configure the username under which you want to login automatically:
```bash
magerun2 config:store:set system/admin/autologin_username exampleAdmin
```

It should now work.
